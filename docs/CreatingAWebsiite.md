title: Creating a Website

## Journal
- it NOT easy 
- if you use the template they give you than its easy, but I wanted to learn how to customise it and change almost everything about 
the template and thats where things got difficult!!
- very fun/frustrating experience
- when i changed the color of the website i was very satisfied , but trying to change the color of a single box around
a logo proved difficult (i have not figure it out)(finally got it)
- adding images of different sizes and comments in the margins is very very cool
- im not a blogger, so not sure how this will come in handy, but i was able to leard about quarto, html, css, scss, and r markdown
which is a big plus
-still have not at all mastered this and will need plenty of time to perfect this website, but im determined to make it look pleasing
to the eye and not a graphic nightmare. 
- in the beggining my goal for this website was to make it fun, cute, and entertaining, but I think there needs to be a set of 
professionalism to it, which made me rething my goal (so i have not made it public)

## Notes (specifically to creating the website)
